#   === === === Working With Data === === ==== 


#   GOOD TO KNOW:
# - Record (also called a structure, struct, or compound data): 
#   A basic data structure. Records in a database or spreadsheet are usually called "rows". 
#   A record is a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typically in a fixed number and sequence.
# - Records are provided. The exercise will be about sorting, searching, and altering those records. 
# - 'My First IMDB':
#   The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online database containing information and statistics.
#   It's all about movies, TV shows and video games as well as actors, directors and other film industry professionals.


#   THE MISSION:
# - This program will import the movie data, and print the answer to the following question. The answer is one single movie title, with double quotes. The question is: 
# - Matthew Broderick sucks. He makes every movie one point worse. 


#   Judd Nelson is harsh. He makes every movie one point better. Moreover, he's so cool, that his coolness is contagious and does not obey the laws of space-time. 
#   Anyone who has ever been in a movie with Judd Nelson, makes every other movie they're in one point better. 


# - In other words:
#   note_I ----> Matthew Broderick ----> rating of the movie goes down with one point. 
#   note_II ----> Judd Nelson ----> rating of the movie goes up with one point.
#   note_III ----> Actor who has acted with Judd Nelson ----> rating of the movie goes up with one point.


# - With all that in mind: 
#   What's the best Ally Sheedy movie?
